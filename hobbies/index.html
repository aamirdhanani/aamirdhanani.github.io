      <h2>Sim Racing</h2>
      <p>Ever since I was little I have always been into cars. I have tried out a few racing sims however most of my time is spent on the dinky one I have at home. The one in the image is probably a bit too overkill.... and would require a whole room to house. It was fun to use though!</p>
