          The goal of this site is to serve almost as a public journal.
          Ideally I keep this updated with everything that I have done and enjoy.
          If you see anything that you would like to chat about, reach out!
          I am slowly writing about the topics listed on the pages so if something
          isn't fully talked about (or looks like AI currently), I haven't been able
          to build upon the topic yet.
